Multi-crystal analysis with DIALS and BLEND
===========================================

Introduction
------------

BLEND_ is a CCP4 program for analysis of multiple data sets. It attempts to
identify isomorphous clusters that may be scaled and merged together to form a
more complete multi-crystal dataset. Clustering in blend is based on the refined
cell parameters from integration, so it is important that these are determined
accurately. Unfortunately, for narrow wedges of data (where BLEND is most
useful) cell refinement may be complicated by issues such as the high
correlation between e.g. the detector distance and the cell volume.

.. _BLEND: http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/blend.html

One solution is to fix detector parameters during cell refinement so that the
detector is the same for every dataset processed. However, this is only feasible
if an accurate detector model is determined ahead of time, which might require
the use of a well-diffracting sacrificial crystal. If we only have the narrow
wedges of data available then it is more complicated to determine what the best
detector model would be to fix.

If we can make the assumption that the beam and detector *did not move* during
and between all of the datasets we collected then we can use DIALS joint
refinement to refine all of the crystal cells *at the same time*, simultaneously
with shared detector and beam models.

In this tutorial, we will attempt to do that for 73 sweeps of data collected
from crystals of TehA, a well-diffracting integral membrane protein measured
using *in situ* diffraction from crystallisation plates at room temperature.
Each sweep provides between 4 and 10 degrees of data.

This tutorial is relatively advanced in that it requires high level scripting
of the DIALS command line programs, however candidate scripts are provided and
the tutorial will hopefully be easy enough to follow.

Individual processing
---------------------

We start with a directory full of images. It is easy enough to figure out
which files belong with which sweep from the filename templates, however note
that the pattern between templates is not totally consistent. Most of the sweeps
start with the prefix :samp:`xtal`, but some have just :samp:`xta`. One way of
getting around this annoyance would be to use the fact that each dataset has
a single :samp:`*.log` file associated with it and identify the different
datasets that way. However, we would prefer to come up with a protocol that
would work more generally, not just for the TehA data. Happily we  can just
let DIALS figure it out for us::

  dials.import /path/to/TehA/*.cbf

  The following parameters have been modified:

  input {
    datablock = <image files>
  }

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DataBlock 0
    format: <class 'dxtbx.format.FormatCBFMiniPilatus.FormatCBFMiniPilatus'>
    num images: 2711
    num sweeps: 73
    num stills: 0
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Writing datablocks to datablock.json

With a single command we have determined that there are 73 individual sweeps
comprising 2711 total images. Running the following command will give us
information about each one of these datasets::

  dials.show datablock.json

That was a smooth start, but now things get abruptly more difficult.
Before we perform the joint analysis, we want to do the individual analysis
to compare to. This will also give us intermediate files so that we don't have
to start from scratch when setting up the joint refinement job. Essentially
we just want to run a sequence of DIALS commands to process each recorded sweep.
However we can't (currently) split the datablock into individual sweeps with
a single command. We will have to start again with :program:`dials.import` for
each sweep individually - but we really don't want to run this manually 73
times.

The solution is to write a script that will take the :samp:`datablock.json` as
input, extract the filename templates, and run the same processing commands
for each dataset. This script could be written in BASH, tcsh, perl,
ruby - whatever you feel most comfortable with. However here we will use Python,
or more specifically :program:`dials.python` because we will take advantage of
features in the cctbx to make it easy to write scripts that take advantage
of `parallel execution <http://cctbx.sourceforge.net/current/python/libtbx.easy_mp.html>`_.
Also we would like to read :samp:`datablock.json` with the DIALS API rather than
extracting the sweep templates using something like :program:`grep`.

.. highlight:: python

The script we used to do this is reproduced below. You can copy this into a file,
save it as :samp:`process_TehA.py` and then run it as follows::

  time dials.python process_TehA.py datablock.json

On a Linux desktop with a Core i7 CPU running at 3.07GHz the script took about 8
minutes to run (though file i/o is a significant factor)
and successfully processed 41 datasets. If time is short, you
might like to start running it now before reading the description of what the
script does. If time is *really* short then try uncommenting the line
:samp:`tasklist = tasklist[0:35]` to reduce the number of datasets processed.::

We will now describe what is in this script. The first lines are
just imports to bring in modules from the Python standard library as well as
:samp:`easy_run` and :samp:`easy_mp` from :samp:`libtbx` (part of cctbx),
:samp:`DataBlockFactory` from :samp:`dxtbx` to read in the datablock and
a class from the :samp:`dials.test` package that simplifies running commands in
a new directory. Following that is a definition for the function
:samp:`process_sweep` which will perform all the steps required to process one
dataset from images to unmerged MTZ. The code block under::

  if __name__ == "__main__":

are the lines that are executed when the script starts. First we check that the
script has been passed a path to a datablock. We then extract the 73 sweeps
from this into a list, then get the filename templates from each element in the
list. We associate each of these templates with a number to form a list of
'tasks' to pass into :samp:`process_sweep`, but instead
of doing this in serial we can use :samp:`easy_mp` to run in parallel. This will
be okay because inside :samp:`process_sweep`, we ensure that all results are
written into a new directory. First we use a facility of the :samp:`easy_mp`
module to determine the number of processes to run in parallel and then we submit
the job with :samp:`parallel_map`.

Within :samp:`process_sweep` all external commands are run within a :samp:`with`
block where execution is controlled by the *context manager* :samp:`cd`. If you
want the gory details, they are `here <https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers>`_.
Essentially this is a way to write clean code that tidies up after itself
properly. In this case, we will create a new directory, execute commands in that
directory, then change back to the old directory afterwards. If the directory
already exists, this will fail with an error.

The commands that are run inside the managed block are usual dials commands,
familiar from other tutorials. There are a couple of interesting points
to note though. We know that the correct space group is *H* 3, but it turns out
that if we ask :program:`dials.index` to find an *H* 3 cell right from the start
then many of the sweeps fail to index. This is simply because the initial models
contained in :samp:`datablock.json` are too poor to locate a cell with the
symmetry constraints. However, for many of the sweeps the indexing program will
refine the *P* 1 solution to the correct cell. For this reason we first run
indexing in *P* 1::

  dials.index datablock.json strong.pickle output.experiments=P1_experiments.json

and then we feed the refined :file:`P1_experiments.json` back into
:program:`dials.index` specifying the correct symmetry::

  dials.index P1_experiments.json strong.pickle space_group='H 3'

When :program:`dials.index` is passed an :file:`experiments.json` containing
a crystal model rather than just a :file:`databock.json` then it automatically
uses a :samp:`known_orientation` indexer, which avoids doing the basis vector
search again. It uses the basis of the refined *P* 1 cell and just assigns
indices under the assumption of *H* 3 symmetry. The symmetry constraints are
then enforced during the refinement steps carried out by :program:`dials.index`.
This procedure gives us a greater success rate of indexing in *H* 3, and required
no manual intervention.

Following indexing we do scan-static cell refinement::

  dials.refine experiments.json indexed.pickle scan_varying=false outlier.algorithm=tukey use_all_reflections=true

Outlier rejection was switched on in an attempt to avoid any zingers or other
errant spots from affecting our refined cells. Without analysing the data closer
it is not clear whether there are any particularly bad outliers here. We could repeat
the whole analysis with this switched off if we want to investigate more closely,
or look through all the :file:`dials.refine.log` files to see results of the
outlier rejection step.

We elected use all reflections rather than taking a random subset because these
are narrow wedges and there are few reflections anyway. Taking a random subset
is only a time-saving procedure, and it won't provide much benefit here anyway.

We don't bother with the time-consuming step of scan-varying refinement, because
it is the scan-static cell that will be written into the MTZ header. Scan-
varying refinement would give us better models for integration but as we will
only be running blend in 'analysis' mode we are in the unusual situation of not
actually caring what the intensities are. In this case, the MTZ file is just a
carrier for the globally refined unit cell!

Following refinement we integrate the data in a very quick and dirty way, simply
to get an MTZ file as fast as possible. This is a terrible way to integrate
data usually!::

  dials.integrate refined_experiments.json indexed.pickle profile.fitting=False prediction.dmin=8.0 prediction.dmax=8.1

The :samp:`profile.fitting=False` option ensures we only do summation integration,
no profile fitting, while the :samp:`prediction.dmin=8.0` and
:samp:`prediction.dmax=8.1` options only integrate data between 8.0 and 8.1 Angstroms.
As a result very few reflections will be integrated. The MTZ file here is just
being used as a carrier of the cell information into blend. By restricting the
resolution range this way we are making it obvious that the content of the file
is useless for any other purpose.

.. warning::

  Do not use the data produced by this script for scaling and merging. More
  careful processing should be done first!

Finally we use :program:`dials.export` to create an MTZ file::

  dials.export refined_experiments.json integrated.pickle mtz.hklout=integrated.mtz

After each of these major steps we check whether the last command ran successfully
by checking for the existence of an expected output file. If the file does not
exist we make no effort to rescue the dataset, we just return early from the
:samp:`process_sweep` function, freeing up a process so that
:samp:`parallel_map` can start up the next.

Here is the output of a run of the script::

Analysis of individually processed datasets
-------------------------------------------

The paths to :file:`integrated.mtz` files can be copied directly into a file,
say :file:`individual_mtzs.dat`, and passed to blend for analysis::

  echo "END" | blend -a individual_mtzs.dat

The dendrogram resulting from clustering is shown here:

  .. image:: /figures/tree_01.png

Immediately the dendrogram shows that dataset 27 is an extreme outlier.
From :file:`FINAL_list_of_files.dat` we can see that this refers to
:file:`sweep_46/integrated.mtz`.
As we kept all the dials :file:`.log` files
from DIALS processing we could investigate this further, however as this is
only one sweep out of 41, we decide just to throw it away and
move on. So, edit :file:`individual_mtzs.dat` to remove
the line :file:`sweep_46/integrated.mtz`
and rerun blend.

Now the dendrogram looks better:

  .. image:: /figures/tree_02.png

The Linear Cell Variation (LCV) is now less than 1%, with an absolute value
of 1.03 Angstroms, indicating good isomorphism amongst all the remaining
datasets.

Joint refinement
----------------

Now that we have done the BLEND analysis for individually processed datasets,
we would like to do joint refinement of the crystals to reduce correlations
between the detector or beam parameters with individual crystals. As motivation
we may look at these correlations for one of these datasets. For example::

  cd sweep_00
  dials.refine experiments.json indexed.pickle scan_varying=false \
    track_parameter_correlation=true correlation_plot.filename=corrplot.png
  cd ..

The new file :file:`sweep_00/corrplot.png` shows correlations between parameters
refined with this single 8 degree dataset. Clearly parameters like the
detector distance and the crystal metrical matrix parameters are highly
correlated.

 .. image:: /figures/sweep_00_corrplot.png

Although the DIALS toolkit has a sophisticated mechanism for modelling
multi-experiment data, the user interface for handling such data is still
rather limited. In order to do joint refinement of the sweeps we need to combine them
into a single multi-experiment :file:`experiments.json` and corresponding
:file:`reflections.pickle`. Whilst doing this we want to reduce the separate
detector, beam and goniometer models for each experiment into a single shared
model of each type. The program :program:`dials.combine_experiments` can
be used for this, but first we have to prepare an input file with a text editor
listing the individual sweeps in order. We can use
:file:`individual_mtzs.dat` as a template to start with. In our case the final
file looks like this::

  input {
    experiments = "sweep_00/refined_experiments.json"
    experiments = "sweep_01/refined_experiments.json"
    experiments = "sweep_02/refined_experiments.json"
    experiments = "sweep_03/refined_experiments.json"
    experiments = "sweep_05/refined_experiments.json"
    experiments = "sweep_09/refined_experiments.json"
    experiments = "sweep_14/refined_experiments.json"
    experiments = "sweep_16/refined_experiments.json"
    experiments = "sweep_17/refined_experiments.json"
    experiments = "sweep_18/refined_experiments.json"
    experiments = "sweep_19/refined_experiments.json"
    experiments = "sweep_22/refined_experiments.json"
    experiments = "sweep_23/refined_experiments.json"

We called this file :file:`experiments_and_reflections.phil` then run
:program:`dials.combine_experiments` like this::

  dials.combine_experiments experiments_and_reflections.phil \
    reference_from_experiment.beam=0 \
    reference_from_experiment.goniometer=0 \
    reference_from_experiment.detector=0

The :samp:`reference_from_experiment` options tell the program to replace all
beam, goniometer and detector models in the input experiments with those
models taken from the first experiment, i.e. experiment '0' using 0-based
indexing. The output lists the number of reflections in each sweep contributing
to the final :file:`combined_reflections.pickle`::

  Saving combined experiments to combined_experiments.json
  Saving combined reflections to combined_reflections.pickle

We may also inspect the contents of :file:`combined_experiments.json`, by using
:program:`dials.show`, for example::

  dials.show combined_experiments.json

Useful though this is, it is clear how this could become unwieldy as the number
of experiments increases. Work on better interfaces to multi-crystal (or
generally, multi-experiment) data is ongoing within the DIALS project.
Suggestions are always welcome!

Now we have the joint experiments and reflections files we can run our multi-
crystal refinement job. First we try outlier rejection, so that the refinement
run is similar to the jobs we ran on individual datasets::

  dials.refine combined_experiments.json combined_reflections.pickle \
    scan_varying=false use_all_reflections=true outlier.algorithm=tukey

  The following parameters have been modified:

  refinement {
    reflections {
      outlier {
        algorithm = null *tukey
      }
    }
  }
  input {
    experiments = combined_experiments.json
    reflections = combined_reflections.pickle
  }

      raise RuntimeError(msg)
  RuntimeError: Please report this error to dials-support@lists.sourceforge.net: Remaining number of reflections = 8, for experiment 19, which is below the configured limit for this reflection manager

Oops! That wasn't good. Looking at the error we see that experiment 19 provides
only 8 reflections to refinement, which is disallowed by a default
parameters of :program:`dials.refine`, namely ``minimum_number_of_reflections=20``.
But from the output of :program:`dials.combine_experiments` we see that experiment
19 has 243 indexed reflections. What happened? Well, forcing the individual
experiments to share the beam and detector models of experiment 0 has led to some
very poor predictions for some of these experiments. See the ``Summary statistics``
table, where the worst positional residuals are greater than 20 mm! We may put this
down to the very narrow wedges of data we have. Experiment 19 is one of the
narrowest, with only 4 degrees of data. Outlier rejection is not a good idea here
because it selectively removes reflections from the worst fitting experiments.

Instead we try without outlier rejection::

  dials.refine combined_experiments.json combined_reflections.pickle \
    scan_varying=false use_all_reflections=true \
    output.experiments=refined_combined_experiments.json

This worked much better::

  The following parameters have been modified:

  output {
    experiments = refined_combined_experiments.json
  }
  refinement {
    reflections {
      use_all_reflections = true
    }
  }
  input {
    experiments = combined_experiments.json
    reflections = combined_reflections.pickle

The overall final RMSDs are 0.17 mm in X, 0.16 mm in Y and 0.12 degrees in
:math:`\phi`. The RMSDs per experiment are also shown, but only for the first
20 experiments. Rerunning with :samp:`verbosity=2` does give the full table,
but also produces a great deal more log output, so it would be easier to find
in the file :file:`dials.refine.log` rather than scrolling up pages in your
terminal.

We can compare the RMSDs from individually refined experiments to those from
the joint experiments. For example, look at the RSMDs for experiment 0, in the
logfile :file:`sweep_00/dials.refine.log`::

Clearly allowing the detector and beam to refine only against this data lets
the model better fit the observations, but is it a more accurate description of
reality? Given that we *know* or can comfortably assume that the detector and
beam did not move between data collections, then the constraints applied by
joint refinement seem appropriate. For better parity with the original results
perhaps we should use outlier rejection though. Now the models are close enough
it is safe to do so::

  ---------------------------------------------
  Table truncated to show the first 20 experiments only

Now we have RMSDs in X down to 0.1 mm, in Y to 0.06 mm and 0.06 degrees in
:math:`\phi`. The RMSDs for experiment 0 are not so much worse than from the
individual refinement job. We are happy with this result and move on to
re-integrating the data to create MTZs for BLEND.

Analysis of jointly refined datasets
------------------------------------

:program:`dials.integrate` will not work with our :file:`refined_combined_experiments_outrej.json`
and :file:`combined_reflections.pickle` directly, so we have to separate these
into individual files for each experiment. It is best to do this inside a new
directory:

.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir joint
  cd !$
  dials.split_experiments ../refined_combined_experiments_outrej.json ../combined_reflections.pickle

This fills the directory with 39 individual :file:`experiments_##.json` and
:file:`reflections_##.pickle` files. To integrate these quickly we want a script
to run in parallel, similar to the one used previously::

  #!/bin/env dials.python
  import os
  import sys
  import glob
  from libtbx import easy_run, easy_mp
  from dials.test import cd

  def process_sweep(task):
    """Process a single sweep of data. The parameter 'task' will be a
    tuple, the first element of which is an integer job number and the
    second is the path to the directory containing the data"""

    num = task[0]
    datadir = task[1]

    experiments_file = "experiments_%02d.json" % num
    reflections_file = "reflections_%02d.pickle" % num
    experiments_path = os.path.join(datadir, experiments_file)
    reflections_path = os.path.join(datadir, reflections_file)

    # create directory
    with cd("sweep_%02d" % num):
      # WARNING! Fast and dirty integration.
      # Do not use the result for scaling/merging!
      cmd = "dials.integrate %s %s " + \
            "profile.fitting=False prediction.dmin=8.0 prediction.dmax=8.1"
      cmd = cmd % (experiments_path, reflections_path)
      easy_run.fully_buffered(command=cmd)
      if not os.path.isfile("integrated.pickle"):
        print "Job %02d failed during integration" % num
        return

      # create MTZ
      cmd = "dials.export %s integrated.pickle mtz.hklout=integrated.mtz"
      cmd = cmd % experiments_path
      easy_run.fully_buffered(command=cmd)
      if not os.path.isfile("integrated.mtz"):
        print "Job %02d failed during MTZ export" % num
        return

    # if we got this far, return the path to the MTZ
    return "sweep_%02d/integrated.mtz" % num

  if __name__ == "__main__":

    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
      sys.exit("Usage: dials.python integrate_joint_TehA.py ..")
    data_dir = os.path.abspath(sys.argv[1])

    pathname = os.path.join(data_dir, "experiments_*.json")
    experiments = glob.glob(pathname)

    templates = [data_dir for f in experiments]
    tasklist = list(enumerate(sorted(templates)))

    from libtbx import Auto
    nproc = easy_mp.get_processes(Auto)

    print "Attempting to process the following datasets, with {} processes".format(nproc)
    for task in tasklist:
      print "%d: %s/experiments%02d" % (task[0], task[1], task[0])

    results = easy_mp.parallel_map(
      func=process_sweep,
      iterable=tasklist,
      processes=nproc,
      preserve_order=True)

    good_results = [e for e in results if e is not None]
    print "Successfully created the following MTZs:"
    for result in good_results:
      print result

This, if saved as :file:`integrate_joint_TehA.py` in the new :file:`joint`
directory can be run as follows::

  dials.python integrate_joint_TehA.py .

As expected this creates all 40 MTZs for the jointly refined sweeps without any
problem. We can copy the paths to these into a new file, say
:file:`joint_mtzs.dat`, and run blend::

  echo "END" | blend -a joint_mtzs.dat

The :file:`tree.png` resulting from this is very interesting.

  .. image:: /figures/tree_03.png

The LCV is now as low as 0.36% (aLCV 0.6 Angstroms). This indicates an even
higher degree of isomorphism than detected during after individual processing.
So although joint refinement leads to slightly higher RMSDs for each experiment
(as we expected) the resulting unit cells are more similar. It is worth
remembering that no restraints were applied between unit cells in refinement.
Given that we know that the detector and beam did not move between the data
collections we might like to think that the joint refinement analysis is a more
accurate depiction of reality, and thus the unit cells are closer to the truth.

What to do next?
----------------

This has given us a good starting point for analysis with BLEND. However, because
of the shortcuts we took with integration we are not yet ready to continue with
BLEND's synthesis mode. At this point we might assess where we are and try a few
things:

* Go back and fix datasets that didn't index properly. We could edit our processing
  script to attempt :samp:`method=fft1d` for example if the 3D FFT indexing was
  unsuccessful.
* Integrate data properly for BLEND's synthesis mode. We should remove the resolution
  limits and allow :program:`dials.integrate` to do profile fitting as well as
  summation integration.
